**!! This is for now an experimental project !!**

## What is Arks?
Arks is an **opiniated** open source (very important term) [React](https://reactjs.org/) framework for creating, developing, building and shipping isomorphics apps built on top of [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/quick-start) and [Apollo GraphQL](https://www.apollographql.com/).<br />
In a defined project structure the CLI will mount an [Express](http://expressjs.com/) server for you and serves a server side rendered React App.<br />
Of course because this framework is an opiniated one it will impose you some constraints to respect.<br />
But don't worry this project is open source it will evolve with time.<br />
The project is divided in several packages and the server comes with some features such as monitoring as it will explain below.

Arks is made to be driven by the community so please feel free to send us your feedback, ideas and PRs!
